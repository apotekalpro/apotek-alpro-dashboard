## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Invite Link Security

**What you should know:**
- ✅ Anyone with the link can join the group
- ✅ Admin can reset the link anytime (old link stops working)
- ✅ Can set expiration date for links
- ✅ No member limit (unless group is full)

### Best Practices

1. **Only share with trusted people** - Don't post links publicly
2. **Reset if compromised** - If leaked, admin can generate new link
3. **Regular rotation** - Consider resetting links periodically
4. **Use admin controls** - Enable "Only admins can add members" if needed

### How to Reset a Link (If Needed)

1. Open group info
2. Go to "Invite to Group via Link"
3. Tap "Revoke Link"
4. Tap "OK" to confirm
5. Get new link → Update mapping file

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Updated Mapping

### Step-by-Step Test

1. **Update one supplier** with invite link
2. **Save Excel file**
3. **Upload** to IM Splitter tool
4. **Process files**
5. **Click "WA Web" or "WA App"** for that supplier
6. **Verify**: WhatsApp should open **directly in the group** ✅

### What You Should See

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Instruction popup says: "Opening directly via group invite link"
- ✅ WhatsApp opens and you're already IN the group chat
- ✅ Pre-filled message is there
- ✅ Just click 📎 → Select file → Send

**If Still in Forward Mode:**
- ❌ Check: Is the link correct format?
- ❌ Check: Did you copy the full link including `https://`?
- ❌ Check: Did you save the Excel file after updating?
- ❌ Check: Did you re-upload the mapping file?

## 📋 Template Mapping File

Here's a template you can use:

```csv
Supplier Name,WhatsApp Target,Notes
PT. MARGA NUSANTARA JAYA,https://chat.whatsapp.com/REPLACE_WITH_REAL_LINK,"Get from group admin"
PT ANUGERAH PHARMINDO LESTARI,https://chat.whatsapp.com/REPLACE_WITH_REAL_LINK,"Get from group admin"
PT. INDOCORE PERKASA,https://chat.whatsapp.com/REPLACE_WITH_REAL_LINK,"Get from group admin"
```

**Instructions:**
1. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_REAL_LINK` with actual invite codes
2. Remove the Notes column before uploading (optional)
3. Save as `.xlsx` file

---

## 🎭 Alternative: Use Phone Numbers

If you can't get group invite links, you can use phone numbers:

**Format:**
```
Column A: PT. MARGA NUSANTARA JAYA
Column B: +628123456789  ← Phone number of supplier or group admin
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Opens direct chat with that person
- ✅ No invite link needed
- ✅ Works for individual suppliers

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Opens individual chat, not group
- ⚠️ You'll need to forward to group manually (or they reply to group)

---

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: What if I'm not the group admin?
**A:** Ask the group admin to share the invite link with you. They can:
- Send it to you via WhatsApp
- Email it to you
- Share it in the group itself

### Q: What if the group has multiple admins?
**A:** Any admin can access and share the invite link. All admins see the same link.

### Q: Do I need a new link for each supplier?
**A:** No! If multiple suppliers go to the same group, use the same invite link for all of them.

### Q: What if I have 50+ groups?
**A:** Collect them gradually:
- Update high-priority groups first (most used)
- Keep group names as fallback for others
- Update more links over time

### Q: Can I test with one supplier first?
**A:** Yes! Update just one row in your mapping file and test it. If it works, update the rest.

### Q: What if the link expires?
**A:** Get a new link from the admin and update your mapping file. Takes 2 minutes.
