# IM Splitter Changelog

## Version 1.1 - UX Improvements (2025-10-25)

### üé® **Issue 1: Professional Layout** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Exported Excel files had default column widths
- Columns were too narrow or too wide
- Content was cut off with `#######` symbols
- Unprofessional appearance

**Solution:**
```python
# Auto-fit all columns to content
for column in new_sheet.columns:
    max_length = 0
    column_letter = get_column_letter(column[0].column)
    
    for cell in column:
        if cell.value:
            cell_length = len(str(cell.value))
            if cell_length > max_length:
                max_length = cell_length
    
    # Set column width with padding (max 50 chars)
    adjusted_width = min(max_length + 2, 50)
    if adjusted_width > 0:
        new_sheet.column_dimensions[column_letter].width = adjusted_width
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ All columns automatically sized to fit content
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance with proper spacing
- ‚úÖ No more `#######` symbols
- ‚úÖ Easy to read without manual adjustments

**Example Column Widths:**
- Column A (Company): 33 characters
- Column B (Supplier): 47 characters  
- Column C (Status): 21 characters
- Column D (Invoice Number): 18 characters
- And so on...

### üîÑ **Issue 2: Double Upload Bug** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Files had to be uploaded TWICE
- First upload didn't register properly
- Confusing user experience
- Wasted time clicking twice

**Root Cause:**
Browser's `<input type="file">` doesn't trigger `change` event when selecting the same file again (even after processing). The input value wasn't being reset.

**Solution:**
```javascript
function handleCompletedFile(file) {
    // ... validation ...
    
    completedFile = file;
    document.getElementById('fileNameCompleted').textContent = file.name;
    document.getElementById('fileInfoCompleted').classList.remove('hidden');
    checkProcessButton();
    
    // Reset file input to allow re-upload
    document.getElementById('fileInputCompleted').value = '';
}
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Files upload correctly on FIRST attempt
- ‚úÖ Can re-upload same file without issues
- ‚úÖ Smooth, intuitive user experience
- ‚úÖ No confusion or repeated actions needed
